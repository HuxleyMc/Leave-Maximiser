# Hack Your Holidays: Introducing Leave Maximiser 🏖️

**Turn your annual leave into extended vacations.**

We all work hard, and we all deserve a break. But 20 days of annual leave doesn't always feel like enough. What if you could double that? Or even triple it?

I've built a tool to help you do exactly that.

## The Secret? Strategic Booking 📅

Public holidays are free days off. The trick is to book your annual leave *around* these public holidays and weekends to create long, continuous blocks of time off while using as few leave days as possible.

For example, if a public holiday falls on a Tuesday, taking just the Monday off gives you a 4-day weekend for the "cost" of 1 annual leave day. That's a 4x Return on Investment (ROI)!

Doing this math manually across a whole year is tedious. **Leave Maximiser does it for you instantly.**

## Features

✨ **Instant Maximization**: Just select your country and year, and see the best blocks to book immediately.
